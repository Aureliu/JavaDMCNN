<BODY>
The Tipster package provides the basic methods for recording
information about documents.&nbsp; It is loosely based on the 'Tipster
Architecture' developed by R.Grishman as part of the Government-sponsored
Tipster program.&nbsp; The basic objects are Documents and Annotations;&nbsp;
a Document is a container for the text of the document, and a set of Annotations
on the Document.
<P>In the course of processing, the Jet system builds up a lot of information
about the words and phrases in a Document:&nbsp; simple things like parts-of-speech
for individual words and type information (person/company/location) for
names, as well as more complex things like phrases and clauses (with internal
structure).&nbsp; We want to have a single class of object for capturing
all of this information and associating it with a Document.&nbsp; The class
we use for this purpose is the Annotation.&nbsp; An Annotation is associated
with a Span (substring) of the text of a Document.&nbsp; The Annotation
has a type and a set of features with values.&nbsp; For example, an annotation
can indicate that a portion of a document is a sentence, or is a token
with a given part-of-speech.&nbsp; More complex structures can be build
by having Annotations which point to other annotations.
<P>A Document is processed in a series of stages, such as tokenization,
sentence splitting, dictionary look-up, pattern matching, etc.&nbsp; Each
stage uses the Annotations placed on the Document by previous stages, and
adds its own Annotations to the Document.
<P>Annotations provide a mark-up capability very similar to that of SGML
or XML (although Annotations do not have to be nested the way SGML/XML
mark-up it).&nbsp; The Document class provides a method for converting
selected Annotations on a Document to XML mark-up, and in the future will
have a method for converting XML mark-up to Annotations.&nbsp; In addition,
the Document class provides a method for viewing a Document and highlighting
selected annotations (this is very primitive at present).
