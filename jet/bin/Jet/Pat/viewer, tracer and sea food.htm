<h2>The JET Pattern Viewer, Pattern Graph Viewer and Pattern Match Tracing with
Sea Food</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>The JET system uses <i>patterns</i>.&nbsp;The patterns are
stored in a pattern file and loaded into the system during initialization and
can also be reloaded by using the JET Console&#8217;s menu <span style='font-family:
Arial'>File | <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Reload Patterns</span>.
The Pattern Viewer views the patterns as a tree based on the structures in
which they are organized in the pattern file. It&#8217;s also used for tracing
pattern matching during execution. The Pattern Graph Viewer views the patterns
as a tree based the directed graph the patterns form.</p>

<h3>The pattern file</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>The patterns are defined in a pattern file.&nbsp; The file
format is defined elsewhere. </p>

<p>Pattern files are suggested to use the file extension&nbsp;&nbsp; <tt><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>.pat</span></tt>. (If so,
the file chooser can use a filter to focus on the pattern files only.)</p>

<h3>Loading the patterns</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>A pattern file can be loaded into the system during
initialization by including a line of the form </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:.5in;mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:
auto;margin-left:.5in'><tt><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Pattern.fileName</span></tt>
= <i>filename</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>in the JET properties file. </p>

<h3>Pattern Viewer</h3>

<p>Launch the Pattern Viewer from JET Console&#8217;s menu <span style='font-family:
Arial'>Patterns | View Patterns</span>. The patterns shown are from the pattern
file defined in the JET properties file. All the patterns are listed in the
first subtree &#8220;Patterns&#8221; with their productions shown as their children. Only
the patterns with action(s) are listed in the second subtree &#8220;Pattern Sets&#8221;,
grouped by their pattern sets, and with their actions shown as their children.
Action nodes have the icon of a <b><i>yellow fish</i></b>.</p>

<p>The Pattern Viewer can also load patterns from another pattern file. Use <span
style='font-family:Arial'>File | Open</span> to open a pattern file.</p>

<h3>Pattern Graph Viewer</h3>

<p>Launch the Pattern Graph Viewer from JET Console&#8217;s menu <span
style='font-family:Arial'>Patterns | View Pattern Graphs</span>. The patterns
shown are from the pattern file defined in the JET properties file. The
patterns form a directed graph. The graph is shown as a tree in the viewer. An
edge and its destination vertex are shown as a tree node. Every vertex in the
graph is named as &#8220;NODE_K&#8221;, where K is a unique number for the vertex. Every
edge in the graph is named as the production it represents, <i>e.g.</i> [token
case=cap]. For simplicity, downstream of a vertex with multiple in-edges is
shown only for the first time the vertex is added to the tree. Null edges are
introduced when necessary (in case of * and +, see the &#8220;pattern classes&#8221; file).
Action nodes have the icon of a <b><i>yellow fish</i></b>.</p>

<p>The Pattern Graph Viewer can also load patterns from another pattern file.
Use <span style='font-family:Arial'>File | Open</span> to open a pattern file.</p>

<h3>Pattern Match Tracing</h3>

<p>Pattern matching during execution can be traced by using tracing options in
the JET Console&#8217;s <span style='font-family:Arial'>Patterns | Pattern Match
Trace</span> and <span style='font-family:Arial'>Patterns | Pattern Apply Trace</span>.
When the trace for certain patterns is on, the trace will be printed in the
Console and if a Pattern Viewer is open, the matched patterns will be
highlighted in the Pattern Viewer with its node&#8217;s icon changed. (Matched patterns
have the icon of a <b><i>pink octopus</i></b>, shown only in the &#8220;Patterns&#8221;
subtree. Applied patterns have the icon of a <b><i>red crab</i></b>, shown only
in the &#8220;Pattern Sets&#8221; subtree.) Reloading a pattern file by <span
style='font-family:Arial'>File | Reload Patterns</span> will updated the <span
style='font-family:Arial'>Patterns | Pattern Match Trace</span> and <span
style='font-family:Arial'>Patterns | Pattern Apply Trace</span> submenus. The
Pattern Viewer and Pattern Graph Viewer should be restarted to have the
underlying patterns updated.</p>

<p>More tracing and graphical editing functions could be added to the Pattern Graph
Viewer in the future but just enjoy the sea food at this time.</p>
