<h1>
The Pattern Classes</h1>

<h3>
Overview:&nbsp; two representations of patterns</h3>
A <b>PatternCollection</b> consists of a set of (named) patterns and a
sequence of <b>PatternSets</b>.&nbsp; Each <b>PatternSet</b> consists in
turn of a sequence of <b>PatternRules</b>.&nbsp; A <b>PatternRule</b> specifies
a pattern to look for in the input text, and a sequence of <b>Actions</b>
to be performed if this pattern is found.&nbsp; It has the structure
<blockquote><b>when</b> pattern, action, action, ...</blockquote>
The basic top-level pattern-matching operation in JET is the application
of a <b>PatternSet</b> to a text segment, by the method PatternSet.apply().
<p>There are two different representations used internally for patterns
and rules.&nbsp; The first representation (the <i>pattern and rule</i>
representation) corresponds closely to the structure of a pattern file:&nbsp;
each pattern is represented separately as a sequence of pattern elements,
and a pattern set is represented as a sequence of rules, where each rule
consists of a pattern (name) and actions.&nbsp; This representation is
used when the pattern file is being read in.&nbsp; It would also be suitable
in the future if we provide some facility for editing patterns interactively.
<p>Once the patterns have all be read in (or, in the future, after the
patterns are modified), each pattern set is converted to a <i>pattern graph</i>.&nbsp;
The graph is a representation of all the patterns in a <b>PatternSet</b>
as a single directed graph.&nbsp; Optional elements, repeated elements,
and references within one pattern to other patterns are "expanded" in the
graph;&nbsp; this simplifies the process of pattern matching.&nbsp; More
importantly, however, the graph is created with a view to graph optimizations
which may be performed in the future.&nbsp; Identical arcs leading from
a node can be merged into a single arc (this corresponds to identifying
common pattern prefixes).&nbsp; In addition, if a large number of arcs
leading from a single node match different strings, these can be reduced
to a hash table to avoid sequential matching of the current token against
each string..
<h3>
AtomicPatternElements</h3>
<b>AtomicPatternElements</b> (an abstract class) are <b>PatternElements</b>
which do not contain embedded references to other <b>PatternElements</b>.Examples
are <b>TokenStringPatternElement</b> (which matches a particular string
appearing as a token), <b>AnnotationPatternElement</b> (which matches an
annotation on the document), and <b>IntegerPatternElement</b> (which matches
an integer token).&nbsp; In the graph representation of the pattern set,
each arc is labeled with an <b>AtomicPatternElement</b>.
<h3>
PatternElements</h3>
In the <i>pattern and rule</i> representation, the patterns are represented
as nested sets of <b>PatternElements</b>.&nbsp; <b>PatternElement</b> is
the abstract class which includes both <b>AtomicPatternElements</b> (described
just above) and various classes for composing pattern elements, such as
<b>PatternRepetition</b>,
<b>PatternSequence</b>,
and <b>PatternAlternation</b>.&nbsp; For example, the pattern
<blockquote><tt>p1 p2 | p3*</tt></blockquote>
is represented as a <b>PatternAlternation</b> with two alternatives;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the first alternative ("<tt>p1 p2</tt>") is a <b>PatternSequence</b> with
two elements, <tt>p1</tt> and <tt>p2</tt>;&nbsp; while the second alternative
("<tt>p3*</tt>") is a <b>PatternRepetition</b>.
<p>Every class of <b>PatternElement</b> has a <tt>toGraph</tt> method for
converting the element into a pattern graph.
<h3>
PatternGraphs</h3>
A pattern graph consists of <b>PatternNodes</b> connected by <b>PatternArcs</b>.&nbsp;
Associated with each PatternArc is an <b>AtomicPatternElement</b> -- the
condition under which this arc may be traversed when matching the pattern
graph against the text.&nbsp; PatternNodes are divided into <b>InternalPatternNodes</b>
and <b>FinalPatternNodes</b>.&nbsp; <b>InternalPatternNodes</b> have outgoing
edges (the alternative pattern elements to matched in the next step of
pattern matching).&nbsp; <b>FinalPatternNodes</b> have sets of actions
-- the actions to be performed if the pattern matching process successfully
reaches this point.
<p>Associated with <b>PatternNodes</b> is an <tt>eval</tt> method which
matches the graph rooted at that node against the text.&nbsp; The <tt>eval</tt>
method on a node invokes the eval method on each <b>PatternArc</b> leaving
the node.&nbsp; The <tt>eval</tt> method on the arc invokes in turn the
<tt>eval</tt>
method on the <b>AtomicPatternElement</b> associated with the arc;&nbsp;
the latter <tt>eval</tt> methods actually test the document (for the presence
of a particular token, for example).
<h3>
Translating Repetitions</h3>
In the pattern-and-rule representation, a repetition (A?, A+, or A*) is
represented by a <b>PatternRepetition</b> object.&nbsp; This is translated
into a graph structure.&nbsp; A* is translated into
