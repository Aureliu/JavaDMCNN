English Lexicon Entries</h1>
In order to keep the size of the <i>external lexicon</i> small, it is convenient
to have a single entry for a noun or verb rather than have to write a separate
entry for each inflected form.&nbsp; For example, we want to have one entry
for "repeat" rather than separate entries for "repeat", "repeats", "repeated",
and "repeating".&nbsp; JET supports this by having a small set of standard
entry types;&nbsp; each entry type is automatically expanded into the various
inflected forms in the internal lexicon.
<p>The basic form of an entry is
<blockquote>defined-item, type, feature = value, feature = value, ... ;</blockquote>
The <i>defined-item</i> is the word or word sequence being defined.&nbsp;
It may be a single word, a sequence of words, or a string enclosed in double
quotes (").&nbsp; If the defined item contains any characters other than
letters, it must be enclosed in quotes.&nbsp; Thus:
<blockquote>cat, noun;
<br>floppy disk, noun;
<br>"cat 'o nine tails", noun;</blockquote>
The <i>type</i> field may be <b>noun</b>, <b>verb</b>, <b>adj</b>, or <b>adv</b>,
or may be empty.&nbsp; If the field is empty, the attribute / value pairs
are used directly to create the internal lexicon entry.&nbsp; In this case,
there should be at least a <b>cat</b> feature, indicating the word category
of the lexical item:
<blockquote>of,, cat=p.</blockquote>
Each feature value may be an integer, a symbol (a sequence of letters beginning
with a lower-case letter), or a string (enclosed in double quotes).&nbsp;
For features representing inflected forms, if the value is a single word,
it may be written as a symbol or string:
<blockquote>ox, noun, plural = oxen;</blockquote>
or
<blockquote>ox, noun, plural = "oxen";</blockquote>
If the inflected form consists of more than one word, or includes a non-letter,
it <i>must</i> be enclosed in quotes:
<blockquote>musk ox, noun, plural = "musk oxen";</blockquote>
The entry types and their features are described below.&nbsp; All features
are optional.
<h2>
Noun</h2>

<blockquote>base-form, <b>noun</b>, <b>plural</b> = plural, <b>attributes</b>
= attributes, <b>xn</b> = xn;</blockquote>
defines a noun (word category <b>n</b>) whose singular form is <i>base-form.</i>&nbsp;
Its plural form is determined as follows:&nbsp; if <i>plural</i> is <b>none</b>,
no plural is defined;&nbsp; if <i>plural</i> is given explicitly, it is
used as the plural form;&nbsp; otherwise the plural form is determined
from the base form as follows:
<blockquote>if it ends in 'x', 'z', 's', 'ch', or 'sh', add 'es'
<br>if it ends in a vowel + 'y', add 's'
<br>if it ends in a consonant + 'y', change the 'y' to 'ies'
<br>otherwise add 's'</blockquote>

<h2>
Verb</h2>

<blockquote>base-form, <b>verb</b>, <b>thirdSing</b> = singular, <b>plural</b>
= plural, <b>past</b> = past, <b>pastPart</b> = past-participle, <b>presPart</b>
= present-participle, <b>attributes</b> = attributes, <b>xn</b> = xn;</blockquote>
defines a verb whose infinitival form is <i>base-form</i>.&nbsp; The following
inflected forms are generated:
<ul>
<li>
a base form, with word category <b>v</b></li>

<li>
third person singular, present tense (word category <b>tv</b> with <b>number</b>
feature = singular):</li>

<br>if not given explicitly, generated following the same rules as plural
nouns
<li>
present tense, plural (also intended to cover first and second persons,
singular) (word category <b>tv</b> with <b>number</b> feature = <b>plural</b>):</li>

<br>if not given explicitly, assumed to be identical to the base form
<li>
past tense (word category <b>tv</b>):</li>

<br>if not given explicitly generated from the base form by the following
rules
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if it ends in 'e', add 'd'
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if it ends in a vowel + 'y', add 'ed'
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if it ends in a consonant + 'y', change the 'y'
to 'i' and add 'ed'
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; otherwise add 'ed'
<li>
present participle (word category <b>ving</b>):</li>

<br>if not given explicitly, generated from the base form by the following
rule
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if it ends in 'e', drop the 'e' and add 'ing'
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; otherwise add 'ing'
<li>
past participle (word category <b>ven</b>):</li>

<br>if not given explicitly, generated from the base form following the
same rules as the past tense</ul>

<h2>
Adjective</h2>

<blockquote>form, <b>adj</b>, <b>attributes</b> = attributes;</blockquote>
defines an adjective (word category <b>adj</b>) with the specified <i>attributes</i>.
<h2>
Adverb</h2>

<blockquote>form, <b>adv</b>, <b>attributes</b> = attributes;</blockquote>
defines an adverb (word category <b>adv</b>) with the specified <i>attributes</i>.
