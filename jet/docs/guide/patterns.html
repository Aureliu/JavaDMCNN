<h1>
<font face="Arial Alternative"><font color="#3333FF">Patterns and Pattern
Matching</font></font></h1>
The pattern matcher lies at the heart of the Jet toolset.&nbsp; It allows
the user to write regular expressions which match sequences of annotations,
and to create new annotations.&nbsp; Most of the language analysis in Jet
is performed using a sequence of pattern matching steps.
<h2>
Jet Pattern Language</h2>
A pattern collection is a sequence of pattern statements, where each pattern
statement is terminated by a semicolon.&nbsp; The basic language has two
statement types, a <i>pattern definition</i> statement and a <i>when</i>
statement, which indicates the action to be performed when a pattern is
matched.
<h3>
Pattern Definition</h3>
A pattern definition has the form
<blockquote>pattern-name : = option<sub>1</sub> | option<sub>2</sub> |
... ;</blockquote>
where where <i>pattern-name</i> is a sequence of letters beginning with
a lower-case letter, and each option<sub>i</sub> is a sequence of repeated-pattern-elements
separated by spaces.&nbsp; A repeated pattern element has one of the forms
<blockquote>pattern-element
<br>pattern-element ?
<br>pattern-element *
<br>pattern-element +</blockquote>
to indicate exactly one, zero or one, zero or more, one or more instances
of pattern-element.&nbsp; <i>Pattern-element</i> in turn may be
<blockquote>a string:&nbsp; "quack"
<br>an annotation:&nbsp; [type feature=value&nbsp; feature=value ...]
<br>the name of another pattern
<br>an alternation:&nbsp; ( option1 | option2 | ... )
<br>as assignment pattern element:&nbsp; variable = value</blockquote>
A string pattern element matches an annotation of type <b>token</b> spanning
the specified string.&nbsp; An annotation pattern element matches an annotation
which has the specified type and features (and may have additional features).&nbsp;
For example, the pattern element
<blockquote>[constit cat=tv]</blockquote>
matches a <b>constit</b> annotation whose feature <b>cat</b> has the value
'tv'.&nbsp; A test of a feature against the <a href="concepts.html">concept
hierarchy</a> (rather than a single value) has the form
<blockquote>feature ?isa(concept)</blockquote>
This feature test succeeds if the value of feature is a word associated
with concept, or associated with some concept' which is a descendant of
<br>concept in the hierarchy.
<h3>
Variables</h3>
A variable name is a sequence of letters beginning with a capital letter.&nbsp;
A variable may be bound in a pattern in several ways.&nbsp; An assignment
pattern element
<blockquote>Variable = value</blockquote>
binds <i>Variable</i> to <i>value</i>.&nbsp; At present, the only values
allowed are integers.&nbsp; A parenthesized pattern may be followed by
a colon (:) and variable name
<blockquote>(pattern ) : Variable</blockquote>
This binds the variable to the <i>span</i> of the document matched by the
pattern.
<p>An annotation pattern element can specify a variable as the value of
one of the features:&nbsp; feature=Variable.&nbsp; If the variable is <i>unbound</i>
when this pattern element is matched against an annotation in the text,
the variable will be bound to the value of this feature.&nbsp; On the other
hand, if the variable is already bound, the pattern element will match
only if the value of the feature is equal to the value of the variable.&nbsp;
For example, the pattern element
<blockquote>[constit cat=vp number=Number]</blockquote>
(assuming this is the first appearance of Number), will bind Number to
the value of the <b>number</b> feature.&nbsp; The sequence
<blockquote>[constit cat=np number=Number]&nbsp;&nbsp; [constit cat=vp
number=Number]</blockquote>
can be used to insure that the value of the <b>number</b> feature on the
<b>np</b>
and <b>vp</b> is the same.
<h3>
When Statements and Actions</h3>
When statements associate patterns with sequences of actions.&nbsp; When
the pattern is matched in a document, the associated actions are performed.&nbsp;
The when statement has the form
<blockquote><b>when</b> pattern-name, action<sub>1</sub>, action<sub>2</sub>,
... ;</blockquote>
At present, three actions are implemented:&nbsp; the <b>add</b> action,
which adds an annotation, and <b>print</b> action, and the <b>write</b>
action.
<h4>
<b>The</b> <b><u>add</u></b> action</h4>
The <b>add</b> action adds an annotation to the text.&nbsp; It has the
form
<blockquote><b>add</b> [annotation-type feature=value feature=value ...]</blockquote>
or
<blockquote><b>add</b> [annotation-type feature=value feature=value ...]
<b>over</b>
variable</blockquote>
In the first form, the span of the new annotation is the text matched by
the pattern.&nbsp; In the second form, the variable must have been bound
to a span as part of the pattern matching;&nbsp; this is used as the span
of the new annotation.
<h4>
The <u>print</u> action</h4>
The print action has the form
<blockquote><b>print</b> stringExpression</blockquote>
where stringExpression can be a string (enclosed in double quotes), a variable,
or a sequence of two or more strings and variables separated by plus signs
(+).&nbsp; A variable in a stringExpression should have been bound to a
span or an annotation as part of the pattern matching process;&nbsp; the
<b>print</b>
action prints the text subsumed by that span or annotation.&nbsp; If the
stringExpression contains two or more items, they are concatenated and
the result printed together on a single line.&nbsp; The output is sent
to the Jet console.
<h4>
The <u>write</u> action</h4>
The write action has the form
<blockquote><b>write</b> stringExpression</blockquote>
It has the same semantics as the <b>print</b> action, except that the output
is written to standard output.
<h3>
Pattern Sets and Pattern Matching Process</h3>
The <b>when</b> statements are organized into <i>pattern sets</i>.&nbsp;
The statement
<blockquote><b>pattern set </b>name;</blockquote>
indicates that all following when statements (until the next pattern set
statment) belong to pattern set <i>name.</i> The basic 'top level' operation
in Jet is the application of a pattern set to a sentence.
<p>The process begins by matching all patterns in the pattern set (i.e.,
all patterns referenced by <b>when</b> statements in the pattern set) starting
at the first token of the sentence.&nbsp; If several patterns match, we
select the pattern which matches the longest portion of the text.&nbsp;
If several patterns match the same (longest) portion, we select the pattern
whose <b>when</b> statement appeared first in the pattern file.&nbsp; The
actions associated with the selected pattern are then executed in sequence
(if no pattern matches, no actions are performed).
<p>The starting point for pattern matching is then advanced and the process
is repeated.&nbsp; If any of the actions created new annotations, the starting
point is set to the maximum of thes end of the annotations.&nbsp; If no
new annotation was created, the starting point is advanced by one token.&nbsp;
The matching continues until the starting point reaches the end of the
sentence.
