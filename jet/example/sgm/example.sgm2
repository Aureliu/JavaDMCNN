15 dead as suicide bomber blasts student bus, Israel hits back in
Gaza

HAIFA, Israel, March 5 (AFP) - Fifteen people were killed and more
than 30 wounded Wednesday as a suicide bomber blew himself up on a
student bus in the northern town of Haifa, the first bombing in
Israel in exactly two months.

Several hours later, dozens of Israeli tanks advanced into the
northern Gaza Strip backed by helicopters which fired at least three
rockets in the Jabaliya area, Palestinian security sources said.

Palestinian medical sources said 60-year-old Mohammed al-Biyari was
killed in his home near Jabaliya refugee camp by the rocket fire and
another wounded.

A second rocket landed in farmlands and the other hit a house inside
the refugee camp, but without causing further casualties, Palestinian
security sources said.

Two 13-year-old children were among those killed in the Haifa bus
bombing, Israeli public radio said, adding that most of the victims
were youngsters. The army said two soldiers were also among the dead.

The bus was ripped to shreds while travelling between a residential
area and Haifa university. Of the 33 injured still in hospital late
Wednesday, two were in intensive care and six others in serious
condition, the radio said.

Israel's night-time raid in Gaza involving around 40 tanks and
armoured vehicles came after Prime Minister Ariel Sharon convened his
security cabinet to discuss a response to the bomb attack.

Israeli media said the retaliation was unlikely to be on a scale that
would risk disrupting US preparations for war on Iraq.

The Palestinian suicide bomber on the Haifa bus came from the
southern West Bank town of Hebron, public radio said, naming him as
20-year-old Mahmoud Hamadan Salim Qawasmi.

Apart from his ID card, also found in the wreckage were the remains
of a letter allegedly outlining his plan to carry out a suicide
attack and praising the September 2001 destruction of the World Trade
Centre in New York, it said.

Israeli police were not immediately available for comment, but
Palestinian sources in Hebron said Mahmoud Qawasmi was a 21-year-old
student with links to the Islamic radical group Hamas.

Israeli forces moved into Hebron's Al-Sheikh district where his
family lived and arrested Qawasmi's brother and father after the
bombing, they said.

Without claiming responsibility, Hamas and another hardline group,
Islamic Jihad, said the blast was revenge for a string of bloody
Israeli army raids into the Gaza Strip in recent weeks.

But the Palestinian Authority condemned the attack, saying it would
divert international sympathy away from the far higher Palestinian
civilian death toll.

"We condemn all attacks against civilians including today's attack in
Haifa," said information minister Yasser Abed Rabbo.

The Palestinian leadership said the attack would serve as "a pretext
for Israel's government and occupation army to step up its deadly
campaign which caused the deaths of 77 Palestinians in February".

It was the first bomb attack inside Israel since January 5, and came
just days after the hawkish Sharon appointed the most right-wing
government in Israel's history on a pledge to get tough on security.

In the January attack, two Palestinian suicide bombers blew
themselves up in central Tel Aviv, killing 23 other people.

Israeli government spokesman Avi Pazner called the latest deadly
blast a "very grave attack" and said the Jewish state would take
"vigorous action against the terrorist organisations".

He told AFP that Israeli intelligence had been dealing with at least
40 tip-offs of impending attacks when the Haifa bus was blown up.

US President George W. Bush condemned the "attack on innocents in
Israel," White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said, adding that "his
message to the terrorists is: Their efforts will not be succcessful.

"He will continue to pursue the path to peace in the Middle East."

EU foreign policy supremo Javier Solana likewise slammed the attack,
although he also took a jab at Israel, saying, "There have been too
many civilians killed in the last weeks and the last days."

In London, a spokesman for the British prime minister said Tony Blair
"condemns absolutely what has happened".

The spokesman added that he "would obviously call on all sides to do
what they can to break the cycle of violence, because it is only
through engagement that we can realise the vision everyone wants to
see.

"There needs to be dialogue in order for this to be resolved."

The bus attack came just two days after Israeli forces staged a
bloody raid into a refugee camp in central Gaza targeting a founding
member of Hamas, which has spearheaded suicide bombings against the
Jewish state.

Hamas vowed to continue its attacks, while the Palestinian Authority
accused Israel of trying to disrupt top-level Palestinian meetings to
discuss reforms of Arafat's administration.

Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erakat said international
intervention was needed to break the cycle of violence.

Eight people, including a pregnant woman and a 13-year-old child were
killed in Monday's Gaza raid, provoking US-led international calls
for Israeli restraint.

And on Tuesday, Israeli troops shot dead an elderly Palestinian
shepherd outside a Jewish settlement on the edge of Gaza City.

In the West Bank, an eight-year-old Palestinian boy as well as his
brother and a sister were wounded late Wednesday by Israeli gunfire
in a village north of the town of Ramallah, their elder sister said.
