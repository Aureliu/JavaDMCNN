Suicide bombing at Israeli shopping mall; fifth attack in two days

JERUSALEM (AP)

A suicide bomber detonated explosives at the entrance to a crowded
mall in northern Israel on Monday, killing at least four shoppers and
wounding 20 in the fifth such attack in two days.

The spate of bombings underscored how difficult it will be to carry
out the U.S.-backed ``road map'' plan, a three-stage prescription for
ending violence immediately and setting up a Palestinian state by
2005.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility for Monday's attack at
the Shaarei Amakim mall in the working class town of Afula, which has
been targeted repeatedly by Palestinian militants because of its
proximity to the West Bank.

The Islamic militant group Hamas carried out four bombings over the
weekend.

The Afula explosion  _	the 95th in 32 months of fighting  _  went
off at 5:14 p.m. (1414 gmt) at the entrance to the mall, reportedly
as shoppers were waiting in line for a security check. Malls and
other public places have significantly stepped up security since the
outbreak of Israeli-Palestinian fighting in September 2000.

The explosion killed the attacker and four shoppers, police said.
Twenty people were wounded, including several who were in serious
condition.

Earlier Monday, a 19-year-old Palestinian riding a bicycle detonated
a 30-kilo (66-pound) bomb near a military jeep in the Gaza Strip,
injuring three soldiers.

In response the spate of bombings, Israel threatened to boycott
foreign envoys who meet with Yasser Arafat. Israel holds the
Palestinian leader responsible for the latest violence, even though
the recent attacks were carried out by Islamic militants.

Hamas said Monday it has no intention of halting attacks, despite
Egypt's efforts to have Palestinian militant groups agree to a
one-year suspension of shootings and bombings. In a renewed mediation
attempt, Egyptian envoys have been holding meetings in Gaza and
Damascus in recent days with leaders of the militant groups. The
armed groups say they might agree to a truce if Israel promises to
stop hunting militants	_  a proposal Israeli Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon has turned down.

A Hamas leader, Abdel Aziz Rantisi, said Monday that ``legitimate
resistance will continue as long as occupation exists on our holy
land.''

Asked whether Hamas was challenging Abbas, Rantisi said only that
there was no point in trying to negotiate with Sharon, whom he called
a ``terrorist.''

Israel said there will be no letup in its campaign against those
involved in violence. Israel ``will continue to fight terror
everywhere, at any time and in any way possible,'' a Cabinet
statement said Sunday, after a Hamas suicide bomber killed seven
Israelis on a Jerusalem bus earlier in the day.

The ministers also decided to cold-shoulder foreign envoys who meet
with Arafat. ``Whoever wants to visit Arafat can visit Arafat but he
won't be allowed to meet senior Israeli officials,'' said a senior
Sharon adviser, Raanan Gissin. Israel first threatened such a boycott
several weeks ago, but enforced it only selectively.

The European Union on Monday dismissed the decision and a spokeswoman
said EU leaders will continue to involve Arafat in the search for
peace.

Arafat, who has been confined by Israel to the West Bank town of
Ramallah for more than a year, accused Israel of inciting against
him.

``Not to forget I condemned it completely, these terrorist
activities,'' Arafat said Monday in halting English, speaking before
the Afula bombing.

``At the same time, you should remember (Israel's) incitement policy
against me. This is to increase the siege around me. Where did it
happen that a president was forbidden from moving out of his
office?''

The new Palestinian prime minister, Mahmoud Abbas, has denounced
violence against Israelis, but also told Sharon in a weekend meeting 
_  the first Israeli-Palestinian summit in three years	_ that he
wants to persuade the militants to stop attacks, rather than disarm
them by force.

The argument over how rein in the militants and halt violence has
been holding up implementation of the road map. The plan calls for
parallel steps in the first stage, including a Palestinian crackdown
on militants, an Israeli troop pullback from Palestinian towns and a
construction freeze in Jewish settlements.

Sharon insists the Palestinians make the first move. He was to have
discussed his objections with U.S. President George W. Bush this
week, but canceled his trip after Sunday's bus bombing. The
Palestinians have accepted the plan as is.

The latest wave of attacks began Saturday evening when a Hamas bomber
blew himself up in a square in the West Bank city of Hebron, killing
an Israeli settler and his pregnant wife. On Sunday morning, another
Hamas assailant blew up the Jerusalem bus and about half an hour
later, a third bomber from the group detonated explosives on the
outskirts of Jerusalem, killing only himself.

Israeli analyst Mark Heller said that ``Hamas is trying to ensure
that the road map doesn't go anywhere and that Abu Mazen (Abbas)
doesn't go anywhere either.''

The three bombers came from Hebron and at one point studied at the
Polytechnic Institute in the city. Two bombers, Fuad Qawasmeh, 18,
and Bassem Takrouri, 19, lived in the same Hebron neighborhood and
were friends. The Israeli military on Monday demolished the Qawasmeh
family home, part of a policy of trying to deter attacks by punishing
assailants' relatives.

The three bombers released farewell videos, apparently taken in the
same wooded area. In frame grabs published in the Yediot Ahronot
daily, the three struck identical poses, holding up assault rifles.
Each wore a green headband with Quranic verses and an olive-colored
vest with pockets for ammunition and grenades.

In another development, Israeli forensics experts identified a body
that washed up on a Tel Aviv beach last week as that of a Briton,
Omar Khan Sharif, 27, the suspected accomplice of a British suicide
bomber who blew himself up outside a Tel Aviv pub April 30. Two
musicians and a waitress were killed in the blast.

Sharif also carried explosives, but they didn't go off, and he fled.
It was not known whether he was hurt at the time. The identification
was made with the help of DNA samples supplied to Israel's Forensics
Institute by British detectives, said the head of the institute, Dr.
Yehuda Hiss. He said Sharif drowned.   pvs-kl
